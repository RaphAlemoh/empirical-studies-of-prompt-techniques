# Ground of Truth

## Overview

The `ground_of_truth/` folder contains the reference implementations for all six exercises (CP-01 to CP-06).

These files represent the correct and verified solutions used as the baseline for evaluation.

## Structure

Ground_of_Truth/
- CP_01_ref.php  
- CP_02_ref.php  
- CP_03_ref.php  
- CP_04_ref.php  
- CP_05_ref.php  
- CP_06_ref.php

## Purpose

The reference implementations are used to:

- Define the expected correct behavior  
- Validate evaluator accuracy  
- Ensure consistency in output comparison  
- Serve as the benchmark for generated solutions  

---

## Notes

- Each file corresponds directly to its respective exercise.
- The implementations are manually verified.
- These files are not modified during experimentation to maintain reproducibility.
