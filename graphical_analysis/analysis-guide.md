# Graphical Analysis of Results

## Overview

This section presents the graphical and statistical analysis of the evaluation results obtained from CP-01 through CP-06.

The analysis focuses primarily on performance metrics such as **Pass@k**, along with comparative and statistical evaluations across models and prompting techniques.

---

## Plotting Pass@k per Exercise

For each coding problem (CP-01 to CP-06), Pass@k results are visualized to:

- Compare model performance
- Identify performance variation across difficulty levels
- Observe consistency trends
- Highlight strengths and weaknesses per task

Bar charts are generated for each exercise to clearly display Pass@1 and Pass@10 results.

## Analysis Folder

The `graphical_analysis/` folder contains all Python scripts used for post-evaluation processing and visualization.

It includes scripts for:

- Generating bar charts
- Producing figures for reporting
- Creating summary reports
- Performing ANOVA statistical analysis
- Exporting structured output results

---

## Output

The analysis process produces:

- Visual comparison charts
- Statistical test results
- Structured reports for thesis documentation
- Exportable figures for inclusion in Chapter 4
