You are a software engineer.

Task:
You are given an array of k sorted singly linked lists. Merge them into one sorted linked list and return the head of the merged list.

Data Structure:
Each node is defined as:
class ListNode {
    public int $val;
    public ?ListNode $next;
    public function __construct(int $val = 0, ?ListNode $next = null) {
        $this->val = $val;
        $this->next = $next;
    }
}

Constraints:
0 <= k <= 10000
0 <= total number of nodes <= 10000
-10000 <= node values <= 10000

Output Requirements:
- Implement:
  function mergeKLists(array $lists): ?ListNode
- Use an efficient algorithm (O(N log k) preferred)
- Output only valid PHP code.

Generate the solution now.
