You are a software engineer.

Before writing any code, think through the logic and edge cases for solving this.

Then write a PHP function called removeDuplicates that takes a sorted array by reference and removes duplicates in place.

Return the number of unique elements. The first k values in the array should be the unique ones in sorted order.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 30000
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.


Only return the PHP code.
Do not use external libraries.
Do not add comments or explanations.
Function name must be removeDuplicates
