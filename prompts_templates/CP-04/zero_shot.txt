You are a software engineer.

Task:
Write a PHP function that computes the maximum profit from an integer array `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on day i.

Rules:
- You may complete as many transactions as you like.
- You can only hold one stock at a time.
- You may buy and sell on the same day.
- Return the maximum achievable profit.

Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 30000
0 <= prices[i] <= 10000

Output Requirements:
- Implement a function:
  function maxProfit(array $prices): int
- Use efficient time complexity (O(n))
- Do not include explanations, only valid PHP code.
