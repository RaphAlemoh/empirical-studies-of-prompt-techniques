You are a software engineer.

Task:
Write a PHP function that computes the maximum profit from an integer array `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on day i.

Rules:
- You may complete as many transactions as you like.
- You can only hold one stock at a time.
- You may buy and sell on the same day.
- Return the maximum achievable profit.

Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 30000
0 <= prices[i] <= 10000

Instructions:
- First, reason internally about the optimal algorithm.
- Then, output only the final PHP implementation.
- Do not include explanations, comments, or reasoning in the output.

Output Format:
- Provide a valid PHP function:
  function maxProfit(array $prices): int
- Ensure O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space.
