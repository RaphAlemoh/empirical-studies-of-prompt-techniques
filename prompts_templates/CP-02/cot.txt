Task:
Given a string `s` containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10000
s consists only of '()[]{}'

Instructions:
- Reason internally about the correct validation strategy.
- Then output only the final PHP implementation.
- Do not include explanations, comments, or reasoning in the output.

Output Format:
- Provide:
  function isValid(string $s): bool
- Ensure O(n) time complexity and O(1) or O(n) extra space.
