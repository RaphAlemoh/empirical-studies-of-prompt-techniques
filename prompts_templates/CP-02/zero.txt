Task:
Given a string `s` containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

Validity Rules:
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every closing bracket must have a corresponding opening bracket.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10000
s consists only of '()[]{}'

Output Requirements:
- Implement:
  function isValid(string $s): bool
- Use O(n) time complexity.
- Output only valid PHP code.
