You are a software engineer.

Below is an example of using a stack-based approach in PHP.

Example:
Task:
Given a string of lowercase letters, return true if the string is a palindrome, otherwise false.

Solution:
<?php
function isPalindrome(string $s): bool {
    $stack = [];
    $chars = str_split($s);

    foreach ($chars as $ch) {
        $stack[] = $ch;
    }

    foreach ($chars as $ch) {
        if (array_pop($stack) !== $ch) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
?>

Now solve this task:

Task:
Given a string `s` containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

Validity Rules:
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every closing bracket must have a corresponding opening bracket.

Output Requirements:
- Implement:
  function isValid(string $s): bool
- Return only valid PHP code.
