You are a software engineer.

Task:
Given an m x n integer matrix where:
- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer target, return true if the target exists in the matrix, otherwise return false.

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 100
-10000 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10000

Output Requirements:
- Implement:
  function searchMatrix(array $matrix, int $target): bool
- Use O(log(m * n)) time complexity.
- Output only valid PHP code.
