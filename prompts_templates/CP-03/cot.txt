You are a software engineer.

Task:
Given an m x n integer matrix where:
- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer target, return true if the target exists in the matrix, otherwise return false.

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 100
-10000 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10000

Instructions:
- Reason internally about how to map the 2D matrix to a 1D binary search space.
- Then output only the final PHP implementation.
- Do not include explanations, comments, or reasoning in the output.

Output Format:
- Provide:
  function searchMatrix(array $matrix, int $target): bool
- Ensure O(log(m * n)) time complexity.
