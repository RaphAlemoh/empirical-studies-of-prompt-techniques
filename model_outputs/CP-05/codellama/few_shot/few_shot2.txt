Here's a possible solution in PHP:
```php
function trap(array $height): int {
    $total = 0;
    $left = array_slice($height, 1);
    $right = array_reverse(array_slice($height, 0, -1));
    for ($i = 0; $i < count($height) - 1; $i++) {
        if ($height[$i] >= $left[$i]) {
            continue;
        }
        if ($height[$i + 1] >= $right[$i]) {
            continue;
        }
        $total += min($left[$i], $right[$i]) - $height[$i];
    }
    return $total;
}
```
Explanation:
The problem statement asks us to find the maximum amount of water that can be trapped in a 2D elevation map represented by an array `height`. We can use two loops to traverse the array and find the maximum difference between each bar and its neighboring bars.

First, we loop through the array from left to right, starting at index 1 (since index 0 is the first bar). For each bar, we check if it has a smaller bar on its left side. If so, we update the variable `left` with the minimum value of the current bar and the previous bar.

Next, we loop through the array from right to left, starting at index `height.length - 2`. For each bar, we check if it has a smaller bar on its right side. If so, we update the variable `right` with the minimum value of the current bar and the next bar.

Then, we loop through the array again, but this time from left to right starting at index 1, and calculate the maximum difference between each bar and its neighboring bars. We use the `min` function to find the smaller of the two values in `left` and `right`, and subtract the current bar's value from that minimum. The result is the amount of water that can be trapped by that bar.

Finally, we sum up all the amounts of water that each bar can trap, and return the total as the final answer.
