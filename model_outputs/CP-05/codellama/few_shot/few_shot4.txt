Here's a possible solution for the trapped water problem:
```php
<?php
function trap(array $height): int {
    // Find the maximum height and its index
    $maxHeight = 0;
    $maxIndex = 0;
    foreach ($height as $i => $h) {
        if ($h > $maxHeight) {
            $maxHeight = $h;
            $maxIndex = $i;
        }
    }

    // Find the minimum height and its index
    $minHeight = 0;
    $minIndex = 0;
    for ($i = $maxIndex - 1; $i >= 0; $i--) {
        if ($height[$i] < $minHeight) {
            $minHeight = $height[$i];
            $minIndex = $i;
        }
    }

    // Calculate the trapped water
    $trappedWater = 0;
    for ($i = $minIndex; $i <= $maxIndex; $i++) {
        $trappedWater += min($height[$i], $minHeight) - $height[$i];
    }

    return $trappedWater;
}
?>
```
Explanation:
The above solution first finds the maximum and minimum heights in the array. It then calculates the trapped water by comparing the minimum height to each element in the array, and adding up the difference between the element and its corresponding minimum height. The result is returned as an integer representing the total units of trapped water.
