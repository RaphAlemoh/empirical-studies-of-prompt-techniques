Task:
Given an array `height` of non-negative integers representing an elevation map, compute how much water can be trapped after raining.

Rules:

* Each bar has width 1.
* Return the total units of trapped water.

Constraints:

1 <= height.length <= 20000
0 <= height[i] <= 100000

Output Requirements:

* Implement: function trap(array $height): int
* Return only valid PHP code.

This is a classic problem of trapping rainwater in a rectangular container. We can solve it by using two pointers to find the highest and lowest bars, and then calculating the water that can be trapped between them.

Here's an example implementation:
```php
function trap(array $height): int {
    // Find the highest and lowest bars
    $highest = 0;
    $lowest = 0;

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($height); $i++) {
        if ($height[$i] > $highest) {
            $highest = $height[$i];
        }

        if ($height[$i] < $lowest || $lowest === 0) {
            $lowest = $height[$i];
        }
    }

    // Calculate the water that can be trapped between them
    $water = 0;

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($height); $i++) {
        if ($height[$i] > $highest) {
            $water += ($highest - $height[$i]);
        } elseif ($height[$i] < $lowest) {
            $water += ($lowest - $height[$i]);
        }
    }

    return $water;
}
```
This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and a space complexity of O(1). The function `trap` takes an array of integers representing the elevation map as its only argument, and returns an integer representing the total units of trapped water.

For example, if we call the function like this:
```php
$height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1];
echo trap($height); // Output: 6
```
It will return the value 6, which represents the total units of trapped water.
