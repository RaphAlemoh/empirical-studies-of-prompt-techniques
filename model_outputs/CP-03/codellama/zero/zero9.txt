```php
function searchMatrix(array $matrix, int $target): bool {
    // Calculate the dimensions of the matrix
    $m = count($matrix);
    $n = count($matrix[0]);

    // Initialize variables for the binary search
    $low = 0;
    $high = $m * $n - 1;
    $mid = ($low + $high) / 2;

    // Perform the binary search
    while ($low <= $high) {
        if ($matrix[$mid / $n][$mid % $n] == $target) {
            return true;
        } elseif ($matrix[$mid / $n][$mid % $n] < $target) {
            $low = $mid + 1;
        } else {
            $high = $mid - 1;
        }
        $mid = ($low + $high) / 2;
    }

    // If the search ends, return false if the target was not found
    return false;
}
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(log(m * n)), which is optimal since it takes at most log(m * n) steps to find the target in the matrix. The binary search algorithm used in this solution ensures that the number of iterations is bounded by the height of the tree, which is O(log(m * n)).
