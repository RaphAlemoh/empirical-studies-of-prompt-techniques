            // If the target is greater than the element, we know it must be in the lower half

            $startRow = $row + 1;
        }
        
        // Check if we have found the target
        if ($matrix[$row][$col] == $target) {
            return true;

This solution uses a binary search algorithm to find the target in the matrix. It starts by initializing variables to keep track of the search bounds and then loops until it finds the target or reaches the end of the matrix. At each iteration, it checks if the target is less than or equal to the element at the current position, and adjusts the search bounds accordingly. If it finds the target, it returns true. If it reaches the end of the matrix without finding the target, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(m * n)), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. This is because the loop iterates at most log2(m * n) times, and each iteration takes constant time to execute.
