Here is a possible implementation of the `searchMatrix` function using logarithmic time complexity:
```php
function searchMatrix($matrix, $target) {
    $m = count($matrix);
    $n = count($matrix[0]);
    
    // Find the row index containing the target
    for ($i = 0; $i < $m; $i++) {
        if (binarySearch($matrix[$i], $target)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

function binarySearch(&$array, $target) {
    $low = 0;
    $high = count($array) - 1;
    
    while ($low <= $high) {
        $mid = (int)(($high + $low) / 2);
        
        if ($array[$mid] === $target) {
            return true;
        } elseif ($array[$mid] > $target) {
            $high = $mid - 1;
        } else {
            $low = $mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```
The `searchMatrix` function takes two arguments: the first is a multi-dimensional array representing the matrix, and the second is an integer representing the target value. It returns a boolean indicating whether the target exists in the matrix or not.

The function works by iterating through each row of the matrix using a for loop, and then calling the `binarySearch` function on each row to find the target value. If the `binarySearch` function returns true, it means that the target exists in the current row, so the function returns true immediately. Otherwise, it continues searching the next rows until all rows have been searched or the target is found.

The `binarySearch` function takes two arguments: the first is a one-dimensional array representing the sorted array to be searched, and the second is an integer representing the target value. It returns a boolean indicating whether the target exists in the sorted array or not.

The function works by using a binary search algorithm to find the index of the target in the sorted array. The `low` variable represents the low end of the range to be searched, and the `high` variable represents the high end of the range. The `mid` variable is used to store the middle index of the range, which is used to compare with the target value. If the target value is found at the middle index, the function returns true. Otherwise, if the target value is greater than the value at the middle index, the function continues searching the right half of the range. If the target value is less than the value at the middle index, the function continues searching the left half of the range. The function repeats this process until the target value is found or the range has been exhausted.

The time complexity of the `searchMatrix` function is O(log(m * n)), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. This is because the binary search algorithm used by `binarySearch` has a time complexity of O(log(n)) for each row searched. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the `searchMatrix` function is O(log(m) * log(n)), which is O(log(m * n)).
