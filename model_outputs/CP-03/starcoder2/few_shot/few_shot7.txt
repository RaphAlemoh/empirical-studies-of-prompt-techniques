Example Input and Output:
Input 1:
    [
        [-5,-4],
        [-3,-2]
     ]
  $target = -5
Output 1: true
Explanation for Input1
    Since -5 is smaller than the last integer of previous row (-2), -5 will be on the left side.
    Now, we are searching in [-5,-2] which means -4, -3 and -2 should be on the right side.
    So there is no -5 exists in [-3,-2].

Input 2: 
    [
        [-10,-9],
        [-8,-7], 
        [-6,-5]
     ]
  $target = 1
Output 2: false
Explanation for Input2
    Since 1 < the first integer of each row, -1 is on the right side.
    Now we are searching in [1,3]. Since no integers smaller than 1 exists on the left side.
    Therefore there's no 1 exist in [1,3] as well.
