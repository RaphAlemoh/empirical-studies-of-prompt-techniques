```php
function isValid($s) {
    $stack = [];

    for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($s); $i++) {
        $char = $s[$i];
        if ($char == '(' || $char == '[' || $char == '{') {
            // Push the character onto the stack
            array_push($stack, $char);
        } elseif ($char == ')' || $char == ']' || $char == '}') {
            // Pop the top character from the stack and check if it matches
            $topChar = array_pop($stack);
            if ($topChar != null && $topChar != $char) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if there are still characters left in the stack
    return count($stack) == 0;
}
```
This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and pops them off as it encounters the corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is empty at the end or if the top character doesn't match the current closing bracket, the string is not valid. The time complexity is O(n) because each character in the input string is only processed once.
