This task requires implementing a stack-based approach to validate the input string for correctness. We can solve this task by using a similar logic as in the previous example, but with some modifications to handle the different characters and their corresponding opening and closing brackets.

Here is an example solution:
```php
function isValid(string $s): bool {
    $stack = [];
    $chars = str_split($s);

    foreach ($chars as $ch) {
        switch ($ch) {
            case '(':
                $stack[] = ')';
                break;
            case '{':
                $stack[] = '}';
                break;
            case '[':
                $stack[] = ']';
                break;
            default:
                if (empty($stack) || array_pop($stack) !== $ch) {
                    return false;
                }
                break;
        }
    }

    return empty($stack);
}
```
In this solution, we use the `str_split` function to split the input string into an array of individual characters. We then iterate over the array and check each character against a set of rules:

* For each opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `{`, or `[`), we push its corresponding closing bracket onto the stack.
* For each closing bracket, we pop the top element from the stack and compare it to the current character. If they are not the same, we return `false`.
* If we reach the end of the input string without encountering any errors, we return `true` if the stack is empty (i.e., all opening brackets have been closed).

This solution should be more efficient than the previous example since it only iterates over the input string once and uses a stack to keep track of the open and closing brackets.
