Here's an example of how you could solve this task using a stack-based approach in PHP:
```php
function isValid($s) {
    $stack = [];
    for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($s); $i++) {
        switch ($s[$i]) {
            case '(':
                $stack[] = ')';
                break;
            case '{':
                $stack[] = '}';
                break;
            case '[':
                $stack[] = ']';
                break;
            default:
                if (empty($stack) || array_pop($stack) !== $s[$i]) {
                    return false;
                }
        }
    }

    return empty($stack);
}
```
Here's how the code works:

1. We start by creating an empty stack.
2. We then iterate through each character in the input string $s.
3. For each character, we check if it is a opening bracket (either '(', '{', or '['). If it is, we push its corresponding closing bracket onto the stack. For example, if we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push a closing parenthesis onto the stack.
4. If we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the top item off the stack and compare it to the current character. If they don't match (e.g. if we have a ')' but the top item on the stack is not an opening parenthesis), we return false immediately.
5. We repeat step 3 until we have processed all characters in the input string.
6. Finally, we check if the stack is empty, indicating that all brackets have been properly balanced and matched. If it is, we return true. Otherwise, we return false to indicate that there are still unmatched brackets.

Note: This code assumes that the input string contains only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'. If you need to handle other special characters or invalid input, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
