Here's a possible implementation of the `isValid` function using a stack-based approach in PHP:
```php
function isValid($s) {
    $stack = [];
    $chars = str_split($s);

    foreach ($chars as $ch) {
        if ($ch == "(" || $ch == "[" || $ch == "{") {
            $stack[] = $ch;
        } else if ($ch == ")" || $ch == "]" || $ch == "}") {
            if (empty($stack)) {
                return false;
            }
            $lastChar = array_pop($stack);
            if ($lastChar != $ch) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            // Invalid character
            return false;
        }
    }

    if (!empty($stack)) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
Explanation:
The function first splits the input string into individual characters using `str_split`. Then it iterates through each character in the input string. If the current character is an opening bracket, such as `(`, `[`, or `{`, it pushes it onto the stack. If the current character is a closing bracket, such as `)`, `]`, or `}`, it checks if the top of the stack matches the current character. If not, it returns false immediately. If the current character is an opening bracket, it pops the top item off the stack and compares it to the current character. If they match, the function continues to the next iteration. If the stack becomes empty before all characters have been processed, or if there are any invalid characters in the input string, the function returns false.

The code above also handles edge cases such as an empty input string or a string with only whitespace characters.
