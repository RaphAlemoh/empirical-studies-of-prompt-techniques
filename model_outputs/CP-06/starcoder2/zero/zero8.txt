// Complexity Analysis:
// Time complexity : O(n * lgn). Where n is the total number of nodes in all lists, 
// and lgn is the time taken by a function call to merge 2 lists. 
//
// Space complexity : O(k). In worst case we might need all k elements at the stack,
// and also all pointers from the input array will be used.
