You are given an array of k sorted singly linked lists. Merge them into one sorted linked list and return the head of the merged list.

Constraints:

* 1 <= k <= 30
* The value of each node in the input linked list will be in the range [-10,000, 10,000].
* Each linked list will have at most 1000 nodes.

Input:
array of k sorted singly linked lists

Output:
head of merged linked list

Solution:
The first step is to merge the two linked lists and then continue merging them until there is only one linked list left. This can be done by creating a new linked list that contains all the elements from the original linked lists, sorted in ascending order.

Here's an example of how you might implement this:

function mergeKLists(array $lists): ?ListNode {
    if (empty($lists)) {
        return null;
    }
    if (count($lists) === 1) {
        return $lists[0];
    }
    $merged = new ListNode();
    $current = $merged;
    while (!empty($lists)) {
        $first = array_shift($lists);
        while ($first !== null) {
            $current->next = $first;
            $current = $current->next;
            $first = $first->next;
        }
    }
    return $merged->next;
}
