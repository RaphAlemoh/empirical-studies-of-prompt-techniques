 Here is a PHP implementation of the merge K sorted linked lists algorithm using the merge sort approach with minimal extra space:

```php
function mergeKLists($lists) {
    if (empty($lists)) return null;

    $n = count($lists);

    for ($level = 1; $level < $n; $level *= 2) {
        $preLevelTail = array();

        for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i += 2 * $level) {
            $current = $temp = null;

            for ($j = $i; $j < min($n, $i + $level); $j++) {
                if (!is_null($lists[$j])) {
                    if (is_null($current)) {
                        $current = $lists[$j];
                    } else {
                        $temp->next = $lists[$j];
                        $temp = $lists[$j];
                    }
                }
            }

            $temp->next = $current;
            $preLevelTail[] = $temp;
        }

        $lists = $preLevelTail;
    }

    return array_shift($lists);
}
```

This implementation works by dividing the given lists into smaller sub-lists of size 2^k, where k <= log2(n). Each sub-list is then merged with its neighbors to create larger sorted lists until only one list remains. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log K) and uses minimal extra space due to merging the lists in-place.
