 Here is the PHP implementation of merging k sorted singly linked lists using a min-heap approach:

```php
function mergeKLists(array $lists): ?ListNode {
    if (empty($lists)) {
        return null;
    }

    $minHeap = new SplMinHeap();

    foreach ($lists as $list) {
        if (!is_null($list)) {
            $minHeap[] = $list;
        }
    }

    $head = null;
    $tail = null;

    while (!$minHeap->isEmpty()) {
        $node = array_shift($minHeap);

        if (is_null($head)) {
            $head = $node;
            $tail = $node;
        } else {
            $tail->next = $node;
            $tail = $tail->next;
        }

        $node = $node->next;
        if (!is_null($node)) {
            $minHeap[] = $node;
        }
    }

    return $head;
}
```

This implementation creates a min-heap from the input linked lists and iteratively pops out the smallest nodes, connecting them to form a single sorted linked list. The time complexity is O(N log k), as it requires N elements (the total number of nodes) and logs each operation in the heap has a logarithmic complexity. Space complexity is minimal because we only use an additional min-heap data structure with size O(k).
