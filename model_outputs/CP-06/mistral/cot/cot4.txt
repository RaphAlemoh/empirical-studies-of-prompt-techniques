 Here is the PHP implementation for merging k sorted singly linked lists:

```php
function mergeKLists(array $lists): ?ListNode {
    if (!$lists) return null;

    $minHeap = new SplMinHeap();
    foreach ($lists as $list) {
        if ($list) $minHeap->insert(new stdClass());
    }

    $head = $prev = new ListNode(null);

    while (!$minHeap->isEmpty()) {
        $min = $minHeap->extractMin();
        $curr = $lists[$min];

        $next = $curr;
        while ($next) {
            $minHeap->insert($next);
            $prev->next = new ListNode($next->val, $next->next);
            $prev = $prev->next;
            $next = $next->next;
        }
    }

    return $head->next;
}
```

In this implementation, we use a min-heap (SplMinHeap) to store the heads of each linked list. At the beginning, if a list is empty, an empty object is inserted into the min-heap to indicate that it should be considered when merging.

We iterate through the min-heap extracting the smallest head and merge its next nodes with the rest of the lists in the heap until it's empty. The final merged list will be stored at `$head->next`.
