 Here is the solution for your task in PHP:

```php
function maxProfit(array $prices): int {
    $minPrice = $prices[0];
    $maxProfit = 0;

    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        if ($price < $minPrice) {
            $minPrice = $price; // update minimum price encountered so far
        } elseif ($price - $minPrice > $maxProfit) {
            $maxProfit = $price - $minPrice; // update maximum profit
        }
    }

    return $maxProfit;
}
```

This function works by maintaining two variables: `$minPrice` and `$maxProfit`. It initializes the minimum price encountered so far with the first stock price, then iterates through the remaining stock prices. If a new stock price is found that is less than the current minimum price, it updates the minimum price. If a new stock price is found that is greater than the minimum price and the difference between them is greater than the current maximum profit, it updates the maximum profit.

The function returns the maximum achievable profit at the end of the iteration.
