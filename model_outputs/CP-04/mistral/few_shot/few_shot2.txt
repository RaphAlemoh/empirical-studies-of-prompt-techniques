 Here's the solution for the given task in PHP:

```php
function maxProfit(array $prices): int {
    $minPrice = $prices[0];
    $maxProfit = 0;

    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        if ($price < $minPrice) {
            $minPrice = $price; // Update the minimum price for future transactions
        } else if ($price - $minPrice > $maxProfit) {
            $maxProfit = $price - $minPrice; // Update the maximum profit if it's higher than current one
        }
    }

    return $maxProfit;
}
```

This function uses a simple approach to find the maximum profit by maintaining a minimum price and comparing it with each subsequent price. If the new price is greater, then the difference between the two prices is added as profit if it's higher than the current maximum profit. The final maximum profit is returned at the end of the function execution.
