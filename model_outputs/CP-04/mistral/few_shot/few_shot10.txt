 Here is a PHP function that computes the maximum profit from an integer array `prices` as per your requirements:

```php
function maxProfit(array $prices): int {
    $profit = 0;
    $minPrice = PHP_INT_MAX;

    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        if ($price < $minPrice) {
            $minPrice = $price;
        } else if ($profit < $price - $minPrice) {
            $profit = $price - $minPrice;
        }
    }

    return $profit;
}
```

This function keeps track of the minimum price encountered so far and checks each price against it to find potential profit. If a profit is greater than the current one, it updates the profit variable. The function returns the maximum achievable profit at the end.
