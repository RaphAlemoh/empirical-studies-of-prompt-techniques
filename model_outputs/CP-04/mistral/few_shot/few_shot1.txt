 Here is a solution for the given task in PHP:

```php
function maxProfit(array $prices): int {
    $minPrice = $prices[0];
    $maxProfit = 0;

    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        if ($price < $minPrice) {
            $minPrice = $price; // update minimum price if current price is less than the minimum price found so far
        } else if ($price - $minPrice > $maxProfit) {
            $maxProfit = $price - $minPrice; // update maximum profit if the difference between the current and minimum prices is greater than the current maximum profit
        }
    }

    return $maxProfit;
}
```

This implementation maintains a running minimum price, and whenever it finds a higher price, it checks if the difference between the two prices is greater than the current maximum profit. If so, it updates the maximum profit accordingly. This continues until all elements in the input array have been processed. The function then returns the maximum achievable profit.
