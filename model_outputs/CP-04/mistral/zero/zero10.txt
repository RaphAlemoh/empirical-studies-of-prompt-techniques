 Here is a PHP function that computes the maximum profit from an integer array `$prices` according to the given rules:

```php
function maxProfit(array $prices): int {
    $minPrice = PHP_INT_MAX;
    $maxProfit = 0;

    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        if ($price < $minPrice) {
            $minPrice = $price;
        } elseif ($price - $minPrice > $maxProfit) {
            $maxProfit = $price - $minPrice;
        }
    }

    return $maxProfit;
}
```

This function maintains the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit obtained by buying at the current price and selling at a previous lower price. It iterates through the array once to find the best possible profit. The time complexity is O(n) as per your requirement.
