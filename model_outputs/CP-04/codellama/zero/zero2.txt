```php
<?php
function maxProfit(array $prices): int {
    // initialize variables for profit and minimum price seen so far
    $profit = 0;
    $minPrice = INF;
    
    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        // update minimum price seen so far
        if ($minPrice > $price) {
            $minPrice = $price;
        }
        
        // calculate profit for this day
        $profit += $price - $minPrice;
    }
    
    return $profit;
}
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We initialize two variables, `profit` and `minPrice`, to zero. The variable `profit` will store the total profit from all transactions, while `minPrice` will store the minimum stock price seen so far.
* We loop through each day in the input array and perform the following steps:
	+ Update the minimum stock price seen so far if necessary (i.e., if the current price is lower than the previous minimum).
	+ Calculate the profit for this day by adding the difference between the current price and the minimum price seen so far to `profit`.
* At the end of the loop, we return the maximum achievable profit from all transactions.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it only involves a single pass through the input array and no additional loops or nested data structures.
