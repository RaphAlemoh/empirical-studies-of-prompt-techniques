Task:
Write a PHP function that computes the maximum profit from an integer array `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on day i.

Rules:
- You may complete as many transactions as you like.
- You can only hold one stock at a time.
- You may buy and sell on the same day.
- Return the maximum achievable profit.

Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 30000
0 <= prices[i] <= 10000

Output Requirements:
- Implement:
  function maxProfit(array $prices): int
- Return only valid PHP code.

Solution:
<?php
function maxProfit(array $prices) {
    $maxProfit = 0;
    for ($i = 1; $i < count($prices); $i++) {
        if ($prices[$i] > $prices[$i - 1]) {
            $maxProfit += $prices[$i] - $prices[$i - 1];
        }
    }
    return $maxProfit;
}
?>
