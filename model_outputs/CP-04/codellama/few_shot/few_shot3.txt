Here is a solution to the task:
```php
function maxProfit(array $prices): int {
    // Initialize variables
    $maxProfit = 0;
    $buyPrice = null;

    // Iterate through the prices and check for buying and selling opportunities
    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        if ($buyPrice === null || $price > $buyPrice) {
            $buyPrice = $price;
        } elseif ($price < $buyPrice) {
            $maxProfit += $buyPrice - $price;
            $buyPrice = null;
        }
    }

    // Return the maximum achievable profit
    return $maxProfit;
}
```
The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize variables `$maxProfit` and `$buyPrice` to 0 and `null`, respectively. These variables will be used to keep track of the maximum profit and the current buy price, respectively.
2. Iterate through the prices using a `foreach` loop. For each price, check if it is higher than the current buy price. If so, update the buy price to that value.
3. If the current price is lower than the buy price, calculate the maximum profit by subtracting the current price from the buy price and adding it to the `$maxProfit` variable. Then, reset the buy price to `null`.
4. Return the maximum achievable profit at the end of the loop.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the input array.
